ArchServer ALMStack

The ArchServer ALMStack is a Software Stack for the development of software providing the whole stack for the
Application Lifecycle Managment. The whole stack is based on the ArchServer (http://www.archserver.org) distribution.

This means basically the following Components:

# Redmine - project management software (bug tracking, wiki, forums, ...) found at http://redmine.org
# Hudson - Continuous Integration Tool found at http://hudson-ci.org
# Maven - the java build management Tool found at http://maven.apache.org
# Sonar - Quality Management Software found at http://sonarsource.org
# Nexus - Maven Repository Management found at http://sonatype.org
# Git - Distributed Version Control found at http://git-scm.org

The components are installed in the currently available VBox Image. 

Components, which do use a database, are installed and configured to use the installed Postgresql-DB. The most
components are reachable via the web, all these applications are hidden behind an apache proxy, and are reachable
via the corresponding url:

# http://HOSTNAME/redmine
# http://HOSTNAME/hudson
# http://HOSTNAME/sonar
# http://HOSTNAME/nexus

and for the maven project sites:

# http://HOSTNAME/maven.

The redmine hudson plugin (http://www.r-labs.org/) is already installed and configured in redmine.

In this project the installation scripts and some additional configuration files (modified files) are published.
